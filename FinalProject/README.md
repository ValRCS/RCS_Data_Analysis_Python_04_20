# Final Project

 You should submit a notebook or even a full github repo

## Your code should

Do at least one of the following:

1. Gathers data (this includes web scraping)
2. Cleans, and rearranges data
 * combines 2 or more sources (for example combines view from SQL select with some JSON)
3. Explores data
4. Visualizes data
5. Builds a model
6. Tests the model(how good the predictions are)
7. Presents full working pipeline in as friendly a form as possible

In real life you'd have to do a bit of all of the above
